Welcome to the Spring gRPC project!

The Spring gRPC project provides a Spring-friendly API and abstractions for developing gRPC applications. There is a core library that makes it easy to work with gRPC and dependency injection, and a Spring Boot starter that makes it easy to get started with gRPC in a Spring Boot application (with autoconfiguration and configuration properties, for instance).

For further information go to our [Spring gRPC reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-grpc/reference/).
